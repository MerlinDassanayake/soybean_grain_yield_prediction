DA5030 Todo List
DONE 1. Finish Chapter 7, do SVM example
DONE 2. Gloss over Chapter 8 & 9

3. Signature Project
	1. Look into how each model needs its data
		- Binary code first variable for all
		1. Multiple Regression
			1.lm function dummy codes cultivars since its factor
			2. Transform variables to improve normality 
			3. Maybe perform PCA after?
		2. Regression Tree
			1. Nothing much besides binary code and one hot encode cultivars, which i assume will happen automatically
		3. SVM
			1. Feature scaling using function from text book
			2. target encode cultivars 
			3. 
DONE 2. Explore data set and distributions
		1. Missing values (if none, remove some and impute i guess)
		2. Outlier removal (probably 3 sd away)
		3. Look for correlation or collinearity
		4. Plots for distributions
	3. Look into feature engineering, maybe target encoding
		1. possible normalization
		2. dummy code
		3. transformation of distributions
		4. Identification of principle components (PCA) IDK how to do this tbh
		5. feature engineering new features possibly
	4. Build datasets for each model
		1. creating training and validation subsets
	5. Build each model
		1. Creation of Model A with proper data encoding
		2. Creation of Model B with proper data encoding
		3. Creation of Model C with proper data encoding
	6. Ensemble
		1. Homogenous ensemble model using bagging?
			1. Validation
		2. Heterogenous ensemble using previous homogenous one and other two
	7. Validate models and calculate metrics (precision, recall, RMSE, MAD), whichever makes sense
